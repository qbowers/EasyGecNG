# EasyGecNG

EasyGecNG is a fork of [EasyGec](http://t.porret.free.fr/lienlogiciel.php?idmenu=60), which is in turn a fork of [Geco](http://sdenier.github.io/Geco/begin/index.html) ([source](https://github.com/sdenier/Geco)). It has been created for [Navigation Games](https://www.navigationgames.org/), a Boston-based non-profit focused on introducing the sport of orienteering to new audiences, especially school children. Geco was developed by Simon Denier, and EasyGec were developed by Thierry Porret. Thierry has kindly given us permission to use and modify his source code.

# Normal Installation Instructions

If you want to install a pre-built version of this software (i.e. you are not a developer), please visit the [release page](https://www.navigationgames.org/about-3), and download these dependencies:
##### 1. JRE 8
  - Windows, Mac: Download and install the latest Java SE Runtime Environment from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html).
  - Linux: install `jre8-openjdk` using your preferred package manager.
##### 2. Drivers
  - Windows: [SportIdent Driver](https://www.sportident.com/products/96-software/161-usb-driver.html)
  - Mac: [CP210x Driver](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
  - Linux: Add yourself to the correct dialout group.
    - In a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), enter the command:
      - `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` on debian-likes (Ubuntu, etc)
      - `sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER` on arch-likes (Arch, Manjaro, etc)
    - Log out, log in, run the `group` command, and check that `uucp`/`dialout` appears in the results. 

# Developer Installation Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

##### 1. JDK 8

  - Linux: The drivers have been [in the linux kernel for a while now](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.c), but you do still need to add yourself to the correct dialout group.
    - In a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), enter the command:
      - `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` on debian-likes (Ubuntu, etc)
      - `sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER` on arch-likes (Arch, Manjaro, etc)
    - Log out, log in, check that the `uucp/dialout` appears in the results of the `group` command.


### 2. Clone the repository
`git clone git@github.com:Navigation-Games/EasyGecNG.git`

`cd EasyGecNG`

### 3. Test build
`./gradlew build`

### 4. Run the App
`./gradlew run`

### 5. That's it!
run `./gradlew tasks` to list available tasks, including running unit tests and building an output jar. Modify available tasks in `app/build.gradle`

## IDE integration

### VSCode
Simply open the correct folder in the editor. Build/run/degub from terminal, or use the following extensions to get Gradle UI buttons:
- [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://open-vsx.org/extension/redhat/java)
- [Gradle for Java](https://open-vsx.org/extension/vscjava/vscode-gradle)
- If you're on the Microsoft-ified version of VSCode, try [this extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)

### IntelliJ
1. Use the "New Project > Get from VCS" button. Put in the url of this git repo.
2. A popup stating "gradle build scripts found." Click `Load Gradle Project`
3. A menu should appear with the available Gradle tasks Double click `EasyGecNG > Tasks > application > run`
4. That's it!

## Generating Documentation
TODO :)
We will use Javadoc

## Generating Releases
TODO :)

### CI/CD
- main branch is always releasable.
- stable releases (the archive bundle with runnable jar, doc, other files...) are built and tagged from time to time from main.
- in the future, we'd like any push to the repository to trigger an automated build, which compile the code and runs tests. This would be implemented with something like GitHub Actions or Travis.

### Manually creating a Release
We need to figure out how to do this. The bundle would ideally include:
- help or doc folder with user documentation
- a jar for development version (???)
- a jar for stable release
- a distribution bundle including jar, user doc, and other files


# Development Guidelines
### Good Practices
- We should be using test-driven development, but we haven't figured out how to do that yet.
- Documentation should be provided using javadoc comments on classes and methods.

### Dependencies
These are managed automatically by Gradle, but also enumerated here. TODO: Licensing
- jSerialComm
- jDom
- jUnit4
- Mockito-core
- [GecoSI](https://github.com/Navigation-Games/GecoSI)
  - jSerialComm
